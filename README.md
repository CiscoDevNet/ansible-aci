# ansible-aci

The ansible-aci project provides an Ansible collection for managing and automating your Cisco ACI environment. It consists of a set of modules and roles for performing tasks related to ACI.

This collection has been tested and supports ACI 3.2+.
Modules supporting new features introduced in ACI API in specific ACI versions might not be supported in earlier ACI releases.

*Note: This collection is not compatible with versions of Ansible before v2.8.*

## Requirements
Ansible v2.9 or newer

## Install
Ansible must be installed
```
sudo pip install ansible
```

Install the collection
```
ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.aci
```
## Use
Once the collection is installed, you can use it in a playbook by specifying the full namespace path to the module, plugin and/or role.

```
- hosts: aci
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
  - name: Add a new EPG
    cisco.aci.aci_epg:
      hostname: apic
      username: admin
      password: SomeSecretPassword
      tenant: production
      ap: intranet
      epg: web_epg
      description: Web Intranet EPG
      bd: prod_bd
    delegate_to: localhost
```

## Update
Getting the latest/nightly collection build

### First Approach
Clone the ansible-aci repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ansible-aci.git
```

Go to the ansible-aci directory
```
cd ansible-aci
```

Pull the latest master on your aci
```
git pull origin master
```

Build and Install a collection from source
```
ansible-galaxy collection build --force
ansible-galaxy collection install cisco-aci-* --force
```

### Second Approach
Go to: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ansible-aci/actions

Select the latest CI build

Under Artifacts download collection and unzip it using Terminal or Console.

*Note: The collection file is a zip file containing a tar.gz file. We recommend using CLI because some GUI-based unarchiver might unarchive both nested archives in one go.*

Install the unarchived tar.gz file
```
ansible-galaxy collection install cisco-aci-1.0.0.tar.gz â€”-force
```
